# note-taker

## Description
My motivation for this project is to help users easily take notes needed and be saved in their databases to review and go back to. Even be able to edit what they need. This project is to help solve the problem of users who need a more efficent and simple way to take notes for their day to day lives. Through this assignement I learned and furthered my knowledge of using the express program to connect routes from the front end to the back end and be able to save such data into the database.
